	* common/fileopen.c (1.20): Input files to fileopen (for reading)
	  can have '.tar.gz' extension, in which case every file in the tar

	  Turn the registry into an optional feature which is automatically
	  used when linked again the hessio library (and that was compiled
	  with GCC). For the bare-bone eventio functionality available with

	  available. For other compilers than GCC, use of the registry with
	  the listio and statio programs requires compiling with
	  -DALWAYS_WITH_REGISTRY.

2014-05-30 17:41  bernlohr

	* Makefile (1.104): Include the list of registered item types also

	* eventio_basic/: TestIO.cc (1.23), eventio.c (1.36), io_basic.h
	  (1.18), testio.c (1.21): Adding the data length of I/O blocks to
	  the item header, for convenient access also with C functions. The
	  actual length is nevertheless maintained in the I/O buffer and
	  not in the item header. The get_item_begin and the put_item_end
	  calls will copy the actual length to the header.

2014-03-28 16:09  bernlohr

	* doc_src/eventio_en.tex (1.8): Updating the eventio documentation.

	  initialization.

2013-12-13 14:34  bernlohr

	* hess/: io_hess.c (1.79), io_hess.h (1.78): Can now report more
	  trigger groups (sectors) associated to a pixel and has more
	  robust handling when reading data with too many of them.  Reading
	  new data with old io_hess code may cause problems though because
	  the old code had a smaller limit and would not tolerate to exceed
	  that limit.

2013-12-13 12:34  bernlohr

	  utility for adding up matching histograms, with the option to

	  actually containing analysis parameters).  Extending the
	  list_histograms utility such that it can extract the contents of

2010-09-09 00:32  bernlohr

	* hess/: camera_image.c (1.19), reconstruct.c (1.38), reconstruct.h

	* eventio_basic/listio.c (1.12): Indentation.

2010-08-06 14:04  bernlohr

	* common/fileopen.c (1.10): Get rid of some of the shells in pipes
	  for compressing/decompressing files on the fly. This may save a
	  bit of main memory. In addition, set errno to EBADMSG if closing
	  a file failed but the underlying fclose/pclose did not set the
	  errno variable.

2010-08-06 13:58  bernlohr

	* Makefile (1.84), fcat.c (1.1): Adding a little test and utility

2009-09-07 18:49  bernlohr

	* hess/reconstruct.c (1.34): When reducing the field of view or
	  otherwise disabling pixels, get rid of those events which
	  certainly cannot trigger a telescope any more (for DST
	  production). Some events will survive which would not have
	  triggered if the pixels were disabled already in the telescope

2009-09-06 17:21  bernlohr

	* hbook/cvt2.c (1.18): Forgot to support the '-A' variant in

2009-07-20 19:05  bernlohr

2009-07-08 18:28  bernlohr

	  analysis.

2009-03-06 11:51  bernlohr

	* hess/: read_hess.c (1.66), user_analysis.c (1.35): A couple of

2009-02-18 12:48  bernlohr

	* hess/read_hess.c (1.64): Got confused myself whether

2009-01-30 17:48  bernlohr

	  names from a file since there are still systems around with
	  rather strict limits on the maximum length of the command line

	  (1.8), reconstruct.c (1.28), reconstruct.h (1.10),
	  user_analysis.c (1.30), user_analysis.h (1.18): A number of
	  reconstruction and cut parameters can now be telescope-type
	  specific. That means you can now write even longer command lines
	  for reconstruction with read_hess ;)

2008-12-11 18:43  bernlohr

	  results together with Hillas parameters etc. into the DST-level
	  data.

2008-10-06 13:48  bernlohr

	* corsika/: io_simtel.c (1.9), mc_tel.h (1.7): Optional mode where
	  photon bunch data is not written in one block for a whole array
	  but in blocks for individual telescopes (enclosed by a header and
	  trailer block). This can save memory for large arrays but chances
	  of getting incomplete data will rise, and overhead in sequential
	  mode will be more severe.

2008-09-12 20:54  bernlohr

	* hess/: io_hess.c (1.41), read_hess.c (1.57), read_hess_nr.c
	  (1.2): Take care of telescope IDs above 255 in a number of data
	  block types.

2008-08-13 17:56  bernlohr

	* hess/io_hess.h (1.41): Fix little typo.

	* hess/rec_tools_nr.c (1.1): Add stripped-down version of
	  rec_tools.c as rec_tools_nr.c.

2008-06-11 14:29  bernlohr

	* Makefile (1.74): In old versions of the Makefile, the binaries
	  were built in the module's top level directory and these were not
	  removed by 'make clean' of a newer Makefile. Remove them each
	  time. Use symlinks to the bin directory if you need them in the
	  top level.

2008-06-06 14:12  bernlohr

	* Makefile (1.73): Improve handling of bin, lib, out, ... when they
	  exist as symbolic links.

	  non-triggered telescopes.

2008-05-19 10:40  bernlohr

	* eventio_basic/: EventIO.cc (1.27), EventIO.hh (1.34): Since the
	  C++ interface, in contrast to the C interface, has a properly
	  initialized item version number which we are prepared to handle,
	  we can warn always about a larger than expected version number,
	  even when the item's read function would fail to check
	  explicitly.

2008-05-15 16:29  bernlohr

	* hess/read_hess_nr.c (1.1): Adding the 'no-reconstruction' version
	  of read_hess to CVS.

2008-05-14 15:05  bernlohr

	* eventio_basic/: EventIO.cc (1.26), EventIO.hh (1.33): Adding an
	  explicit Write() method which is useful for writing filter
	  programs looking just on the top-level block header.

2008-05-14 12:12  bernlohr

	* hess/io_hess.c (1.39): Fix reading back local pulse sums.

2008-05-07 18:31  bernlohr

	  older central trigger data format.

2008-04-13 14:00  bernlohr

	* hess/: io_hess.c (1.36), io_hess.h (1.37): Minor changes in the
	  pulse shape timing data, but probably still buggy.

	* hbook/Makefile (1.19): File type extension for shared library got
	  lost.

2008-03-31 16:13  bernlohr

	  (1.6), doc_src/eventio_en.tex (1.7): Adapting the documention to

2008-03-12 13:08  bernlohr

	* eventio_basic/eventio.c (1.23): Better check for NULL arguments
	  in (put|get)_item_begin after having managed to produce

2008-02-15 17:44  bernlohr

	* hbook/: Makefile (1.17), cernlib_compiler (1.1): We may have to
	  adopt the Fortran compiler to what was used to compile the
	  available CERN library. Choices so far: gfortran or g77.

2008-02-12 16:52  bernlohr

	* Makefile (1.70), hbook/Makefile (1.16): Using now gfortran (if
	  available) as the FORTRAN compiler for the HBOOK interface. Note
	  that this requires a compatible CERNLIB (i.e. compiled with
	  gfortran) to work. If it doesn't work you are not loosing much,
	  since building the hdata2hbook program is optional.

2008-01-11 17:03  bernlohr

	* corsika/io_simtel.c (1.8): Use fileopen/fileclose instead of
	  explicitly opening large files with fopen64.	Optionally check
	  the sum of photon bunches, taking into account that with the
	  EXTENDED_TELOUT option to CORSIKA/IACT there are 'bunches' that
	  refer to the emitting particles and not to the photons emitted.

2008-01-04 14:30  bernlohr

	  Documentation additions plus two additional methods and a few
	  minor fixes.

2007-09-07 18:26  bernlohr

	* eventio_basic/eventio.c (1.20): When putting new sub-items into
	  an I/O buffer and their headers would not fit immediately into
	  the buffer, that's no reason to give up since we can almost
	  always extend the buffer.

2007-09-04 15:56  bernlohr

	* hess/: io_hess.c (1.31), io_hess.h (1.34), read_hess.c (1.52):

	  also with the test programs.

2007-08-21 20:31  bernlohr

	* hess/: io_hess.c (1.30), io_hess.h (1.33): Add another print_...

	  hbook/tohbook.h (1.4), hess/io_hess.c (1.28), hess/io_hess.h
	  (1.29), root/cvt3.cc (1.12): Here comes a rather big set of
	  changes:

	  - This includes the first change to the eventio data format for
	  more than a decade. It provides an optional extension field to
	  item headers of which so far 12 bits have been assigned for
	  extending the length field from 30 bits (1 GByte) to 42 bits (4
	  TByte) on 64-bit systems. On 32-bit systems no I/O blocks of more
	  than 2 GByte can be handled. By default, all data is written in
	  the old format, without extension field. Therefore, all existing
	  software should continue to work as before and writing data that
	  can be read with older eventio versions. Automatic insertion of
	  the extension field, which is possible though extremely
	  inefficient, is not implemented yet. To take advantage of the
	  extension field, one has to set the 'extended' flag in the I/O
	  buffer once or use the put_item_begin_with_flags function with
	  the corresponding flag set for each item that might exceed the
	  GByte barrier.

	  - Another (minor) change to the data format is setting aside a
	  previously reserved bit in the type/version field for a
	  user-controlled flag bit.  If data with this flag set is read by
	  older software, the flag will simply be ignored. Again, by
	  default, everything is written as it used to be.

	  - The testio and TestIO programs have been extended for a more
	  complete coverage of the eventio functionality. Both of them can
	  write and read their data in the old format as well as the
	  extended format.

	  - The C++ interface has been extended to cover the same level of
	  functionality as the C interface, without need to call the C
	  functions directly.

	  - The remaining support for pre-ANSI-C compilers has been
	  dropped.

2007-06-15 12:56  bernlohr

	* common/initial.h (1.9): Avoid warnings about redefined
	  __STDC_LIMIT_MACROS if defined elsewhere.

2007-06-15 12:53  bernlohr

	* common/initial.h (1.8): We need the C limit macros also in C++ in
